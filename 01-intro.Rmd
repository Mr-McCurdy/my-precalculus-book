# Introduction to Precalculus

Precalculus is the essential bridge that transitions you from advanced algebra and trigonometry into the powerful world of calculus. By mastering functions, transformations, and essential theorems here, you’ll build the analytical foundation to tackle limits, derivatives, and integrals. Whether you are heading into science, engineering, economics, or data analytics, the skills you learn in Precalculus will broaden your perspective and problem-solving repertoire.

## Why This Course Matters

1. **Unifying Functions and Graphs**  
   You’ll see polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, and trigonometric expressions in a single cohesive framework. Understanding how to shift, stretch, and combine them is a crucial skill in modeling real-world phenomena.

2. **Laying Groundwork for Calculus**  
   Much of calculus involves analyzing how functions change. Precalculus ensures you’re comfortable describing, manipulating, and interpreting those functions in preparation for rigorous rate-of-change analysis.

3. **Analytical Thinking**  
   The complexity of the problems in Precalculus encourages a more mature mathematical perspective, where each question may require multiple concepts or transformations.

## A Short Theorem

### Factor Theorem {#thm-factor}

**Statement:**  
If a polynomial \(P(x)\) is divided by \((x - a)\), then the remainder is \(P(a)\). Consequently, if \(P(a) = 0\), then \((x - a)\) is a factor of \(P(x)\).

**Why It Matters:**  
This theorem links the concept of polynomial roots to factorization, making it easier to simplify polynomials and solve polynomial equations—two major tasks you’ll handle repeatedly in this course.

## A Sample Quadratic

Consider the quadratic function below, which we will use for illustration throughout the text:

$$
f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3
(\#eq:myQuadratic)
$$

- It factors nicely into \((x - 1)(x - 3)\).
- The graph is a parabola opening upwards.
- Its roots are \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), demonstrating the Factor Theorem (see [@thm-factor]).

```{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3\\) with roots at \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\).", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 9}

# Create a sequence of x-values and their corresponding y-values
x_vals <- seq(-1, 5, length.out = 250)
y_vals <- x_vals^2 - 4*x_vals + 3
